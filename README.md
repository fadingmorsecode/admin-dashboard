# Project Summary:
This project aims to resemble an admin dashboard. Its purpose is to demonstrate understanding and ability to use css grid which was previously learned in the Odin Project curriculum. The dashboard follows a design template provided by The Odin Project. 
# Goals:
* Use grid for layout and positioning of elements
* Incorporate previously learned html/css in project
* Nesting grids within grids
# In Action:

# Reflection:
This project felt very straightforward to me. I felt as though I had a pretty decent grasp on grid due to the documentation that I read and had quite a bit of fun putting this all together. I nested flexbox elements here and there because I felt it was easier in some situations, and I think that's to be expected. Grid and Flexbox both have their pros and cons in some situations and one should be used over the other when in certain scenarios. I really enjoyed laying things out using Grid and I hope to be able to learn even more about it when reaching the advanced html/css lessons in the TOP curriculum. It's quite funny that before grid I was scared of it and was perfectly content with just using Flexbox, but I have since discovered the joy and beauty of being able to use grid as well!
